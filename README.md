# Bias-Variance Tradeoff in Machine Learning

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CYLYABpHQy9R4nWCtAv7Jo7DxMrKLcpI?usp=drive_link)

This Jupyter Notebook provides a hands-on demonstration of the fundamental concepts of **bias** and **variance** in machine learning. Through the use of synthetic data and polynomial regression, we visually explore how model complexity impacts a model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

## What You Will Learn

By working through this notebook, you will gain a practical understanding of:

* **High Bias (Underfitting):** How simple models can fail to capture the underlying patterns in the data, leading to poor performance on both training and test sets.
* **High Variance (Overfitting):** How overly complex models can learn the noise in the training data, resulting in excellent performance on the training set but poor generalization to new data.
* **The Bias-Variance Tradeoff:** The crucial balance between model complexity and generalization ability.
* **Identifying Good Fit:** Recognizing a model with appropriate complexity that effectively captures the underlying signal without overfitting to noise.

## Notebook Overview

The notebook is structured as follows:

1.  **Imports:** Essential Python libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn are imported.
2.  **Bias-Variance Tradeoff Lab (Markdown):** An introduction to the concept of the bias-variance tradeoff and the objectives of this lab.
3.  **Generate Synthetic Data:** Synthetic data resembling a noisy sine wave is created using NumPy. This allows us to have a clear underlying pattern to model.
4.  **Dataset Overview (Markdown):** A brief explanation of the generated dataset and its characteristics.
5.  **Helper Function to Visualize Models (`plot_model`):** A utility function to train a given model on the data and visualize its predictions against the actual data. This function helps in the visual comparison of different model complexities.
6.  **High Bias Model (Linear Regression):** A simple linear regression model is trained on the data. Its performance illustrates the concept of high bias and underfitting.
7.  **High Bias (Underfitting) (Markdown):** An explanation of why the linear model exhibits high bias in this scenario.
8.  **High Variance Model (High-Degree Polynomial Regression):** A complex polynomial regression model (degree 15) is trained. Its behavior demonstrates high variance and overfitting.
9.  **High Variance (Overfitting) (Markdown):** A discussion on why the high-degree polynomial model overfits the training data.
10. **Balanced Model (Moderate-Degree Polynomial Regression):** A polynomial regression model with a moderate degree (degree 4) is trained. This model aims to strike a balance between bias and variance, achieving good generalization.
11. **Balanced Model (Good Fit) (Markdown):** An explanation of how the moderate-degree polynomial model achieves a better bias-variance tradeoff.
